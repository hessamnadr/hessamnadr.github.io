        <h2>#About</h2>
        <p>
            My knowledge in software engineering started in 2009. <br>
            Due to my great interest in the unknown world of computers, I studied at the computer science college. At that time, programming was my most enjoyable pastime.
            <br>
            At first, creativity led me to work in my FriendZone as a front-end web developer and designer. <br>
            My interest is **ideas and imagination** and the realistic part of my mind directs the imagination to create a product that everyone likes. For this reason, I started my professional activity in product design and development in 2013.
            <br>
            During this 10-year period, many experiences of specialized challenges and cooperation in teams, companies and businesses have been gained, each one more valuable than the other, so I am happy with my progress. 💎
            <br>
            In February 2020, with the start of Corona and quarantine, I decided to start working on my innovative idea and launched the Melkba startup.
            <br>
            Currently, I am the founder of the company and the managing director of Navai Aramesh Khaneh. <br>
